# what is this?
a fork of the [eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza) project - a modern alternative to ls
# what's different?
all i've changed are the unicode codes in `src/output/icons.rs` to show emojis instead of nerd font icons
# why not change icons with `theme.yml` released in eza 0.19.2?
at the moment when this fork was created changing icons for directories or executables wasn't a feature (or atleast i couldn't've figure it out)
